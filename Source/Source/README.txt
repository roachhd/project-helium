This is the Source directory from project-helium/Source/Source.
Inside you will find all the JavaScript, CSS, Images, Fonts, and other resources in their source form.
The distributed versions are built with Closure compiler to minimize the javascript.

To test the source code, you will need to use test.html NOT index.html. index.html is here only because this is where it is copied from during compilation.

All files in this directory and its subdirectories are provided under the Apache License.
